2. **Choose a** [**Model**](https://docs.pornx.co/getting-started/create-your-image/models)**:** Select your preferred model type, like _xSweet_, _Movie_, or Photorealism, to determine the overall look and feel of your image. Feel free to explore and try new things without hesitation!
3. **Go with a** [**Prompt**](https://docs.pornx.co/getting-started/create-your-image/prompt-feature)**:** Begin by entering a detailed prompt describing the image you want to create. This is the foundation for your image generation.
4. **Select Filters & Parameters:** Adjust settings such as style, model, resolution, and more. You can fine-tune your image with the [**Creativity**](https://docs.pornx.co/getting-started/create-your-image/creativity) and [**Quality**](https://docs.pornx.co/getting-started/create-your-image/quality-images) options for a more refined result.
