## **Basic Prompt Structure**

A typical prompt for [PornX](https://pornx.co/) can be broken down into the following components:

- Subject: What you want to generate (e.g., "a seductive woman," or "a couple in an intimate setting);
- Style/Modifier: The artistic style, mood, or additional characteristics (e.g., "in a boudoir style," "with soft lighting");
- Background: The environment or context in which the subject exists (e.g., "in a luxurious bedroom," "in a tropical paradise");
- Details/Attributes: Specific attributes or features you want to emphasize (e.g., "wearing lace lingerie," "with a sultry expression").

**There are two inputs for prompts**

- **Positive Prompt**: This is the area where you put things you want to see.
- **Negative Prompt**: This is the area where you put things you **do not** want to see. The more you fill this area out, the more accurate your result will be. The more the merrier in this case.

<Check>
  **When writing your prompt, it is best to follow this order :**

  / Who do you want to get (woman, man, character, etc.)

  / Race or skin color.

  / How far is it from the camera ( portrait, closeup portrait, whole body)

  / In what position (sitting, standing, lying, etc.)

  / Details on the head (emotion, hair, eyes, etc.)

  / The human figure and its details (busty, skinny, medium ass, natural breasts, etc.)

  / Clothing and accessories (starting from the head)

  / Location where the person or character is located

  / Type of lighting

  / In what style to draw
</Check>

<Warning>
  **AVOID:**

  In some cases, conflicts may arise - when you describe body parts that are in front and behind a person or character (For example, big ass and big breasts, in this case, it would be better to remove one thing. Or here you can change big ass to wide hips, as this part of the body is visible from the front)

  **Don't overload your prompt!**

  Avoid using many of the exact trigger words, such as `best quality, better quality, 2k,4k,8k, photorealism, photorealistic, insane quality...` etc.

  Just use only 1-2 words in this category.
</Warning>

<Info>
  **Modifiers:**

  Using brackets to include details and writing a number (example:1.3) can either increase or decrease the effect of this word. The range of numbers can be from 0.1 to 1.5, and if you want to make a keyword that AI will always pay attention to, then just put it in brackets ()

  You can highlight the main words or give out the power of a word to several, but the main thing is not to overdo it (on average, highlight about 5 words)

  There is also a \*\*BREAK \*\*feature, which allows you to share several prompts in one scene.  For example, you want to describe the scene in more detail:

  `blue sky, sun, clouds, birds`

  `BREAK`

  `river, autumn, forest, perfect blonde woman, sitting`
